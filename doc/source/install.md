# Install Fastscapelib

Choose the way to install Fastscapelib that best suits your needs. In general we
recommend installing either the C++ or Python library using [conda] (or
[mamba]).

(download-fastscapelib)=

## Download the Fastscapelib Source

You can either download the last stable version as an archive
[here](https://github.com/fastscape-lem/fastscapelib/releases/latest) or you can
clone the source repository using git (by default it will clone the active
development `main` branch):

```bash
$ git clone https://github.com/fastscape-lem/fastscapelib
```

(install-cpp)=

## Install the C++ Library

Fastscapelib C++ is header-only and requires a recent compiler that supports the
C++17 standard. It also depends on:

- [xtensor] (C++ array computing)
- [cmake] (build and configuration)

See Section {doc}`build_options` for more details on how to include Fastscapelib
in a (CMake) project.

(install-cpp-conda)=

### Using Conda

Fastscapelib [conda] packages are available for all stable versions via the
conda-forge channel. You can install Fastscapelib's C++ headers and all the
dependencies using the following command (alternatively you can use [mamba] or
[pixi]):

```bash
$ conda install fastscapelib -c conda-forge
```

(install-cpp-source)=

### From Source Using CMake

In addition to a C++ compiler supporting C++17, you need [xtensor] and [cmake]
that you can install, e.g., using [conda]:

```bash
$ conda install xtensor cmake -c conda-forge
```

After {ref}`downloading the Fastscapelib source <download-fastscapelib>`, run
the commands below from the source root directory to install the fastscapelib's
header files using CMake:

```bash
$ cmake -S . -B build -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/path/to/prefix ..
$ cmake --build build
$ cmake --install build
```

Where `/path/to/prefix` is the path where the header files will be installed
(skip this option if you want to install Fastscapelib in a default location).

If you have installed [xtensor] in a custom directory, you can help CMake find
it by setting the `-DXTENSOR_DIR` option.

See Section {doc}`build_options` for more information on the available build
options.

(install-python)=

## Install the Python Library

Fastscapelib's Python package requires Python (3.10+) and [numpy].

(install-python-binary)=

### Pre-compiled packages (recommended)

#### Conda

All stable versions of Fastscapelib-Python are available as pre-compiled binary
[conda] packages for Linux, MacOS and Windows via the conda-forge channel. You
can install it using the following command (alternatively you can use [mamba]):

```bash
$ conda install fastscapelib-python -c conda-forge
```

#### Pip

All stable versions of Fastscapelib-Python are also available on
https://pypi.org/ as binary wheels for Linux, MacOS and Windows. You can install
it using [pip]:

```bash
$ python -m pip install fastscapelib
```

(install-python-source)=

### From Source Using Pip

In addition to Python and Numpy, building and installing Fastscapelib-Python
from source requires [pip], [pybind11], [xtensor-python] and [scikit-build-core]
(a C++ compiler supporting C++17 is also required). All these dependencies are
all available on conda-forge:

```bash
$ conda install python numpy pybind11 xtensor-python scikit-build-core pip -c conda-forge
```

After {ref}`downloading the Fastscapelib source <download-fastscapelib>`, you
can build and install the Python package using `pip`. Run the following command
from the source root directory:

```bash
$ python -m pip install . --no-build-isolation
```

The ``--no-build-isolation`` option is required since xtensor-python cannot yet
be installed using pip. You can pass extra options like in the example below,
which builds the Python extension in ``Debug`` mode in a given directory (useful
for cached builds):

```bash
$ python -m pip install . \
$   --no-build-isolation \
$   --config-settings=cmake.build-type=Debug \
$   --config-settings=build-dir=build/skbuild
```

See [scikit-build-core]'s documentation for more available options.
