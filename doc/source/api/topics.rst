The fastscapelib library is organized into the different topics here
below. You can either include all functions in your project with the
following line

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include "fastscapelib/fastscapelib.hpp"

or include just a subset of the functions (by topic), e.g.,

.. code-block:: cpp

   #include "fastscapelib/flow_routing.hpp"

.. toctree::
   :maxdepth: 2

   flow_routing
